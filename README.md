# Aloha Project by Amelia Garvin
 
The Aloha Project is a mobile first, responsive website created for a fictional clothing brand named Aloha Apparel.

The Aloha Project is the first amongst many learning opportunities in the world of website development.

 This project displays what I have learned to so far as well as marks the areas in which there is room for growth!

## Getting Started

The Aloha Project is able to launch because it contains an index.html file, a css file and an upcoming Javascript file.


### Prerequisites

Launching the website in google chrome will allow the website to perform at its best!


### Installing

Double clicking on the file named "Index.html" in the Aloha directory will launch the website in your default browser.

## Running the tests

The html and css code were validated in the W3C validators. 

One error occured on line 143 on the css file, however was unable to fix it.

The html showed to have no errors.


## Deployment

The project is pushed on github so that it can be deployed by all who wish to view it!
